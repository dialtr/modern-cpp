# modern-cpp

## About

The goal of this repo is to provide simple examples of features that are now
available in "modern" C++. Each feature has its own directory to make them
easy to locate.

## Disclaimer

Despite using C++ for a long time, I do not consider myself an expert on the
language. While I will make an attempt to ensure that my commentary is
accurate, this repo should not be considered an authoritative reference. It
is also not a *complete* reference.

Primarily, my goal here is selfish: I want to learn about modern C++, and
since I find that the best way to learn is by doing, I've created this repo
as a forcing function to write "modern" C++.
